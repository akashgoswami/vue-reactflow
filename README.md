# vue-reactflow

This a demo project to showcase [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) and [Vuera](https://github.com/akxcv/vuera) inside the Vue.js application. 
Using React inside Vue is definitely an anti-pattern, however sometimes it may be required to use it. 

This application shows a basic Reactflow Class Component and composing a graph of Test and conditions. Any suggestions to
improve the integration or streamline the code are more than welcome.
